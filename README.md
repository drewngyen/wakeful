# wakeful.

This is a small project that calculates the time you should wake up when given a desired bedtime.
It uses sleep cycles to determine the appropriate time.
As a PWA this app can be saved to the home screen and is designed to test new features in react such as hooks, the styled-components lib and the framer-motion lib on mobile devices.
